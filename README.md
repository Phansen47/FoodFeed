## Description
We are creating an app that will allow people to create and ssave recipes for food and drinks. It will include private logins and the ability to create a profile where the user can save and view their recipes.
## Installation

Log in using the example account with email jordan99@msn.com and password password12345. Once logged in, the user can view the recipes associated with their account and add new recipes. 

## User Story
As a chef, I want to easily find and save recipes, so that I don't have to spend a lot of time looking for recipes.

## Usage
This app can be used as a virtual cookbook where users can save recipes and view them later on when they'd like to cook them.
